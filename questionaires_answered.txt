# Final Year Project Submission

================================================================================
1. STAKEHOLDER QUESTIONNAIRE
================================================================================

## A. Business & Objectives

### Q1: What are the specific business KPIs you expect the forecasting system to improve?
**Answer:**
For this final year project demonstration, the system targets the following KPIs:
- **Stockout Reduction**: Reduce stockouts for A and B category SKUs by 25-30% 
- **Excess Inventory Reduction**: Reduce dead stock and excess inventory by ~15%
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Improve MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) by 20-25% for weekly forecasts on top product categories
- **Service Level (OTIF)**: Increase On-Time In-Full delivery metrics
- **Inventory Turnover**: Improve inventory turns through optimized replenishment recommendations

### Q2: Which time horizons matter most operationally?
**Answer:**
- **Daily/Weekly (Primary)**: Most critical for store-level and distributor replenishment decisions
- **Monthly (Secondary)**: Important for production planning and raw material procurement
- **Quarterly (Tertiary)**: Used for high-level scenario planning and budgeting only
The system clearly distinguishes between operational forecasts (daily/weekly) and planning forecasts (monthly/quarterly).

### Q3: Which planning roles will use the forecasts?
**Answer:**
- **Demand Planners (Primary Users)**: Interact with system daily, monitor forecasts and anomalies
- **Production Planning Teams**: Consume monthly/quarterly forecasts for production scheduling
- **Category Managers**: Use system during promotion planning cycles
- **Distributors/Field Sales**: Access simplified order proposals only (not model internals)
- **Operations Managers**: View dashboards for strategic decision-making

### Q4: Which decisions will be automated vs. human-in-the-loop?
**Answer:**
- **Automated**: 
  - Generate recommended order quantities
  - Calculate safety stock levels
  - Routine replenishment suggestions
  - Anomaly detection and flagging
- **Human-in-the-Loop**:
  - Override decisions for promotions, supply constraints, or high-uncertainty periods
  - Production planning final approval
  - Model retraining approval
  - Exception handling for anomalies

### Q5: Which SKU × location aggregation levels are required?
**Answer:**
- **High-Volume SKUs**: SKU × Store or SKU × Distributor level granularity
- **Medium-Volume SKUs**: SKU × Region level acceptable
- **Long-Tail SKUs**: Category-level or pooled models with transparent logic
The system dynamically handles different granularity levels without hardcoding.

### Q6: Are there hard constraints the system must respect when recommending replenishment?
**Answer:** Yes, the system explicitly respects:
- Lead times between suppliers, DCs, and stores
- Minimum order quantities (MOQ)
- Pallet/truck load constraints
- Shelf life for perishable products (DAIRY, BEVERAGES)
- Maximum storage capacity at locations
- Transportation scheduling windows

### Q7: What is the acceptable level of forecast uncertainty for operational use?
**Answer:**
- System always shows confidence intervals (e.g., 80%, 95% prediction intervals)
- High-risk forecasts (uncertainty exceeding threshold) are flagged for planner review
- Service-level targets: 95% in-stock for A-category SKUs, 90% for B-category
- Uncertainty visualization is mandatory for all forecast outputs

## B. Data Availability & Quality

### Q8: What exact historical tables exist and who owns them?
**Answer (Simulated for Project):**
| Table | Description | Owner |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| daily_timeseries.csv | Daily sales, demand, inventory, prices | Data Engineering |
| sku_master.csv | SKU metadata, categories, pricing | Master Data Team |
| location_master.csv | Store/DC locations, regions | Operations |
| festival_calendar.csv | Festival/holiday dates | Business Analytics |
| monthly_macro.csv | Macroeconomic indicators | External Data Team |

### Q9: What is the lowest data granularity and retention?
**Answer:**
- Daily data reliable for 10+ years (synthetic dataset simulates 10 years: 2006-2015)
- Older data exists but may be aggregated monthly
- Granularity: SKU × Location × Day level with channel breakdown
- System handles uneven historical depth appropriately

### Q10: How complete is the historical data?
**Answer:**
Expected data quality issues (handled by the system):
- Missing values (~5-10% in some tables)
- Duplicate records requiring deduplication
- SKU code changes over time (rebranding)
- Inconsistent unit measurements
- Negative inventory adjustments
Strong data validation, logging, and correction logic implemented.

### Q11: Are promotions recorded at transaction-level or campaign-level?
**Answer:**
Historical promotions may be poorly documented. System designed to:
- Use explicit promo_flag when available
- Infer promotional effects from price drops and abnormal sales spikes
- Support both campaign-level and transaction-level promotion data

### Q12: Is there a canonical SKU master with consistent identifiers?
**Answer:**
- SKU master maintains canonical identifiers
- System tracks SKU lineage for rebranding and pack size changes
- Pack-size conversions available in master data
- Concept drift simulation includes SKU rebranding every 5 years

### Q13: Are shipment/lead-time records available?
**Answer:**
Lead times estimated empirically from shipment/receipt timestamps. 
Planners can override defaults for exceptional cases.
Default lead times by region and supplier stored in configuration.

### Q14: Can we pull external data?
**Answer:** Yes, the system integrates:
- **Weather Data**: Historical and forecast weather (API integration)
- **Festival/Holiday Calendar**: Nepal-specific and standard holidays
- **Macroeconomic Indicators**: GDP growth, CPI, consumer confidence
- **Competitor Activity**: Price monitoring and promo detection (optional)

## C. Business Rules & Domain Knowledge

### Q15: Are there category-specific rules we must encode?
**Answer:** Yes:
- **Perishables (DAIRY)**: 14-day shelf life, 5-15% daily spoilage factor
- **Semi-Perishables**: 90-day shelf life
- **Stable Products**: 365-day shelf life
- Pack size cannibalization effects
- Mandatory display promotion rules

### Q16: How do promotions typically affect sales?
**Answer:**
- Short aggressive discounts: 25-50% off for 3-14 days
- Long-running price cuts: Gradual effect on demand
- Promo depth affects price elasticity (simulated in dataset)
- Festival periods: 10-80% sales uplift within ±3 days of festival

### Q17: Are there recurrent patterns tied to local festivals?
**Answer:** Yes, Nepal-specific festivals captured:
- Dashain (October)
- Tihar/Deepawali (October-November)

- New Year celebrations (January, April)
- Major religious festivals

### Q18: Who are power users for model explanations?
**Answer:**
- Demand planners need top-5 drivers per forecast explanation
- Category managers want promotion uplift analysis
- Operations managers need high-level dashboard summaries
- Technical users may access SHAP values and feature importance
